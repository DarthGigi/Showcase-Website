## General Server Activity

This section is mostly dedicated to how you must conduct yourself in Sirius.

### Follow Discord's Terms of Service

Please follow the Discord Terms of Service, failing to do so may result in your Discord account being permanently terminated or 'disabled'. Read the terms here: [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)

### Releasing Private Information

While pretending to release private information as a joke is bordering breaking the rules, it is allowed, on the condition that it is clearly a joke. We'd recommend refraining from using this as a joke as you never know if you'll be banned.

### Deliberate Spread of Malware or other kinds of viruses

Sending links of Malware, Trojans, Viruses, IP grabbers, scams, and more will result in you breaching this rule. This includes crash or logging media.

### Advertising and Marketing

Sending post-like messages of advertisements, invites to Discord servers with unreasonable context, and more will put you in violation of this rule.

### Evading Moderation Actions

Leaving the server after an action has been taken against you, or bribing/asking a moderator to take away your punishment by lying about what happened will put you in breach of this rule.

### Cracked Products/Scripts

Sending links to cracked software, files with cracked content, or even having links to them in your bio/About Me or status will result in you having broken this rule.

## Message Contents

This section is about how you present yourself in Sirius. This includes messages and voice chat.

### Spamming

Spamming creates disruption for all users in the chat. Spamming is when you repeatedly send the same or similar types of messages in a row in the same or several channels at the same time. This does not include code blocks or large paragraphs (unless it's clearly nonsense)

### Discrimination and Prejudice

Sirius is in no way in support of racist ideals, discrimination, or other methods of targeting a specific ethnic or religious group or community. This includes prejudice, segregation, racial ideologies, etc. This also covers words that are often used in the context to target a specific group or community.

### Inappropriate and Adult Content

Sending GIFs, Images, or any other form of media (including links) which include NSFW content will result in you having broken this rule. This includes server invites to NSFW servers and links to adult websites.

### Hacking and exploiting tools

Sharing or selling hacking tools or methods of exploiting systems, for example, accessing someone's account or taking down a website, is against the rules and isn't allowed in Sirius.

## Reporting Users

Messages that you believe are against these rules can be reported at any time by right-clicking the message, then selecting Apps > Report message. Fake reports will result in punishment.
