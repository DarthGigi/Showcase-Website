# Refund Policy

## Eligibility

- Customers are eligible for a full refund within 14 days of purchase or within 7 days of first running the software, whichever comes first.
- Refunds are only available for purchases made directly through the Sirius Store.

## Refund Process

- To initiate a refund, customers must submit a support request through the [Discord Server](https://sirius.menu/discord).
- Customers should provide their purchase details, including the payment method used and email, along with a brief explanation of the reason for the refund request.
- Upon receipt of the refund request, our support team will review the request and provide assistance in resolving any issues.
- If the issues cannot be resolved, a full refund will be issued back to the original payment method, and your license will be revoked.

## Non-Refundable Items

- Upgrades from Essential to Pro and any purchases made with Robux are non-refundable.

## Refund Verification

- Our support team will work closely with customers to address their concerns and provide solutions to their issues.

## Refund Denial

- Refunds may be denied if a customer is found to be in violation of our terms of service.
- Other circumstances for refund denial may include fraudulent activities or misuse of the software.

## Communication
